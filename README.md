## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13.5 or higher
- pip package manager
- Administrative privileges (for network monitoring)



---

## üíª Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Select Operation Mode**
   - Start Monitoring: Begin Instagram phishing simulation
   - Clear Logs: Remove all activity traces
   - Setup Tunnel: Configure ngrok tunnel for remote access
   - Exit: Terminate application

3. **Access the Simulation**
   - Navigate to the provided local or tunnel URL
   - Instagram login page will be served to visitors
   - Monitor real-time activity through the CLI dashboard

### How It Works

1. **Victim Access**: User visits the Instagram simulation page
2. **Credential Collection**: Login credentials are captured and verified
3. **Session Extraction**: Valid sessions generate session IDs for analysis
4. **2FA Handling**: If 2FA is enabled, the system presents the 2FA page
5. **Token Management**: CSRF tokens are handled automatically
6. **Data Logging**: All interactions are logged for security analysis

### Data Collected

The tool collects the following information for educational analysis:

**System Information:**
- IP Address and Geolocation
- Operating System and Version
- Browser Type and Version
- Device Model and Hardware Specs
- Screen Resolution and Display Info

**Session Data:**
- Login Credentials (for verification)
- Session IDs (when authentication succeeds)
- 2FA Codes (if applicable)
- CSRF Tokens and Security Headers
- Interaction Timestamps and Patterns
